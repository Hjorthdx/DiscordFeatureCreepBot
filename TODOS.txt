# TODO
    # BOT PART
(X)    Bot skal forlade rummet selv efter mp3 fil er slut eller ved command måske.
    Change on_message !karma so it only needs to include !karma, so you could see karma of other users.
        E.g. !karma Hjorth - Would return the total karma of Hjorth no matter who the author is.

    # POMODORO PART
(X)    Pomodoro basic timer funcionality.
(X)    Pomodoro makes bot join and play sound when time is up.
(X)    Pomodoro default timers hvis andet ikke er specified.
    Pomodoro !time så vi kan se hvor lang tid der er tilbage af en timer

    # PLAY PART
(X)    !play latex bastards - FILE ADDED.
(X)    !play bamse - DEN NYE POMODORO LYD.
    !play pomodoro lyd start/slut.
(X)    Maybe seperate file for alle playing, if it starts to grow any bigger.
        Makes the code more reable.
        It is growing out of hand, please make a new file that contains the playing part,
        so the if statements in bot is not so big.
            Maybe it can be abstracted more and the play document can handle which file to play.
            if "something" in message.content
                Player.Play(message) -> Some if chain in there that does the choosing of what to play. 
                Only problem right now is that they are all different, !latex, !play, !inspiration etc.
                MAYBE !p inspiration, then that would be a lot simpler and a lot less if in the bot file.
    !play farvelsangen.
(X)    # Figure out some way to make it choose the channel with users in
(X)    !Motivationsbot - DU GØR DET OG DU GØR DET GODT.

    # DB
    Database skal sættes op til at være online - lav prio.
    Reset all the data in the database, cause sten's id is different from everyone elses,
        and it's pissing me off.
    Add collection for work/time.
