    # POMODORO PART
    User needs to be able to STOP the timer
    User needs to be able to PAUSE the timer
    Make bot ask if you've forgotten to start timer. If there are like 5+ people in voice channel, then it should ask if a timer is needed
        Could be very helpful cause we always forgot those stupid timers
        https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#voicechannel -> Members returns a list of all the users in a specific voice channel,
            maybe have some loop.wait_for(members.count >= 7) -> if timer not started, ask user if they want a timer started.
    Comment inside pomodoro doucment needs to be done
    @everyone when timers are up.
