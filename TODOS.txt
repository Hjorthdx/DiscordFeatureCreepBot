# TODO
    # General things
        Tolower all user inputs, so they are not change sensitive.
        Make installation guide to use the bot

    # USER CLASS
        Add default values for pomodoro timers, so every user can change their default with the !change default command.
        I think database, needs to keep track of the timer aswell, if that needs to be changed.

    # BOT PART
    Needs to add highscores for both opdutter og neddutter.
        Maybe give roles based on these, and let them update once someone else takes the lead.

    # POMODORO PART
    User needs to be able to STOP the timer
    User needs to be able to PAUSE the timer
    Make bot ask if you've forgotten to start timer. If there are like 5+ people in voice channel, then it should ask if a timer is needed
        Could be very helpful cause we always forgot those stupid timers
        https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#voicechannel -> Members returns a list of all the users in a specific voice channel,
            maybe have some loop.wait_for(members.count >= 7) -> if timer not started, ask user if they want a timer started.
            https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.on_member_update USE THIS

    # Wikipedia speedrun

        Let players join the game before it starts.
        Start a timer on !start command
        !done command, that returns the time it has run.
            Possibly save this in database so we can have roles for this aswell.
        Et array med mulige ting vi skal finde - !add til listen.

Add timer per user instead of name.
