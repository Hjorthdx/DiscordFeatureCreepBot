# TODO
    # General things
        Tolower all user inputs, so they are not change sensitive.
        Make installation guide to use the bot

    # USER CLASS
        Add default values for pomodoro timers, so every user can change their default with the !change default command.
        I think database, needs to keep track of the timer aswell, if that needs to be changed.

    # BOT PART
    Needs to add highscores for both opdutter og neddutter.
        Maybe give roles based on these, and let them update once someone else takes the lead.

    # POMODORO PART
    User needs to be able to STOP the timer
    User needs to be able to PAUSE the timer
    Make bot ask if you've forgotten to start timer. If there are like 5+ people in voice channel, then it should ask if a timer is needed
        Could be very helpful cause we always forgot those stupid timers
        https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#voicechannel -> Members returns a list of all the users in a specific voice channel,
            maybe have some loop.wait_for(members.count >= 7) -> if timer not started, ask user if they want a timer started.
            https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.on_member_update USE THIS
                TALKED TO SIMON ABOUT THIS. THIS SHOULD WORK
    Comment inside pomodoro doucment needs to be done
    @everyone when timers are up.
    Needs to play in every room that there are peopple in
    When there is a break play the lofi radio

    # PLAY PART
    !play pomodoro lyd start/slut.
    !play farvelsangen.
    !p let me in
    Boomer alert
    Lofi radio

    Player class that has playing status. If playing - then add it to queue, so it doesnt cause error everytime multiple people play audio clip.
    

    # DB
    Database skal sættes op til at være online - lav prio.

    # Wikipedia speedrun
        Et array med mulige ting vi skal finde - !add til listen.

Add timer per user instead of name.


Fix pomodoro
    Needs more seperation of concern
    Seperate everything, so that unit tests can be developed
        Create the unit tests so we can ensure that they dont fail like they do now.
    Fix the remaining time command. Should give an error is negative time
        Doesnt do that now, just tells there is -x time left on the timer.

Add remind me feature
    Checks if any current remind me's are stored. If so
        Check if its past the reminder
        Start countdown again if still time left
    Store a reminder in db and start a countdown.
